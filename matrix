I woke up inside my dream and i was out of the matrix and everything inside was green even the kitchen
i went back into the matrix and got into the kitchen, a green hue was luminating the room coming from the windows, suddenly, i looked onto the bread cutting table and a door opened next to me, i went in and found myself next to the kitchen with some kind of concrete walkway under me
then i grabbed a knife, cut a bread, and woke up
